## Introduction

Experiment transform numerical and categorical features to higher-dimension vector.

The structure of source code as following:
- **preprocessing** folder: conduct **preprocessing** steps written in *Python* including:
    + preparing data to train **featuretransformation**:  *concept_definition.json* and *data_train_xxx.csv*
    + preparing data for **merge_tool**: insert data directly into database
- **merge_tool** folder: contains a Web application written in *Vuejs* which aims to merge **itemid** from 2 sources *CareVue* and *Metavision*
- **feature_transformation** folder: this source code based on implementation of FastText written in *C++*. With *concept_definition.json* and *data_train_xxx.csv*, the output model transforms <itemid, value> pair to vector.


## Requirements

### Prepocessing

Read **Set up** step in **preprocessing/README.md**

### Merge tool

Read **Set up** step in **merge_tool/README.md**

### Feature transformation

Read **Requirement** step in **feature_transformation/README.md**

## Step-by-Step

* Database: setup Mimic database (read **SetupMimic.md**)
* Merge items: run **mege_tool** websites
* Prepare data: generate `concept_definition.json` and `data_train.csv`. Both of them are generated by `Python` code. For more detail, read `feature_transformation/README.md`
* Transform features: using CBOW or using Skipgram
* Train model PLOS: TODO
